# Shitclick

Shitclick is a very simple but fun game. It is all about clicking and collecting shit. Yep, shit. The more shit you have, the better upgrades you can purchase to increase automatic shit collection for example.

The game was created by [Max Boll aka MyXoToD](http://myxotod.com) but is currently developed by his very own [Bullgit team](http://bullg.it).
